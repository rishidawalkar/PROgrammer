<center><h3>Inheritance.</h3></center>
<br>
    <h5><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Inheritance</b> is one of the key features of OOP (Object-oriented Programming) that allows us to define a new class from an existing class.<br>&nbsp&nbsp For example,
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspclass Animal
<br>&nbsp&nbsp{
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp  // eat() method
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp  // sleep() method
<br>&nbsp&nbsp}
<br>&nbsp&nbspclass Dog extends Animal
<br>&nbsp&nbsp{
 <br>&nbsp&nbsp   // bark() method
<br>&nbsp&nbsp}
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspIn Java, we use the <b>extends</b> keyword to inherit from a class. Here, we have inherited the <b>Dog</b> class from the <b>Animal</b> class.

        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe <b>Animal</b> is the superclass (parent class or base class), and the <b>Dog</b> is a subclass (child class or derived class).<br>&nbsp&nbsp The subclass inherits the fields and methods of the superclass.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Inheritance</b> is an is-a relationship. We use inheritance only if an is-a relationship is present between the two classes.

<br>&nbsp&nbspHere are some examples:

<br>&nbsp&nbspA car is a vehicle.
<br>&nbsp&nbspOrange is a fruit.
<br>&nbsp&nbspA surgeon is a doctor.
<br>&nbsp&nbspA dog is an animal.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Types of inheritance</b>
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.Single inheritance</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspSingle inheritance is defined as the inheritance in which a derived class is inherited from the only one base class.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2019/05/Single.png">
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>2.Multilevel inheritance</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspMultilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.itbunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0.png?resize=317%2C237">
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>3.Multiple inheritance</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspMultiple inheritance is the process of deriving a new class that inherits the attributes from two or more classes.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://www.learncpponline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/multiple-inheritance-c-plus-plus1.jpg">
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>4.Hybrid inheritance</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspHybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://www.csestack.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hybrid-Inheritance.png">
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>5.Hierarchical inheritance</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspHierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.
