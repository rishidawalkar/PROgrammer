<center><h3>Object oriented systems development.</h3></center>
<br>
    <h5><br>&nbsp&nbspWe know that the Object-Oriented Modelling (OOM) technique visualizes things in an application by using models organized around objects. <br>&nbsp&nbspAny software development approach goes through the following stages −

<br>&nbsp&nbsp1.Analysis,
<br>&nbsp&nbsp2.Design, and
<br>&nbsp&nbsp3.Implementation.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Phases of Object-Oriented Software Development</b>
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.Object–Oriented Analysis</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspIn this stage, the problem is formulated, user requirements are identified, and then a model is built based upon real–world objects. <br>&nbsp&nbspThe analysis produces models on how the desired system should function and how it must be developed. The models do not include any &nbsp&nbspimplementation details so that it can be understood and examined by any non–technical application expert.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>2.Object-Oriented Design</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspObject-oriented design includes two main stages, namely, system design and object design.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>i. System design</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspIn this stage, the complete architecture of the desired system is designed. The system is conceived as a set of interacting subsystems that in turn is &nbsp&nbspcomposed of a hierarchy of interacting objects, grouped into classes.<br>&nbsp&nbsp System design is done according to both the system analysis model and the proposed system architecture. Here, the emphasis is on the objects &nbsp&nbspcomprising the system rather than the processes in the system.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>ii.Object design</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspIn this phase, a design model is developed based on both the models developed in the system analysis phase and the architecture designed in the &nbsp&nbspsystem design phase. All the classes required are identified. 
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>3.Object oriented implementation and Testing</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspIn this stage, the design model developed in the object design is translated into code in an appropriate programming language or software tool. &nbsp&nbspThe databases are created and the specific hardware requirements are ascertained. Once the code is in shape, it is tested using specialized &nbsp&nbsptechniques to identify and remove the errors in the code.
