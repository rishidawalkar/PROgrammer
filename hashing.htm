<center><h3>Hashing.</h3></center>
<br>
<h5>
 &nbsp&nbsp<b> Hashing</b> is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. <br> &nbsp&nbspSome examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:
<br>
 &nbsp&nbspIn universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
<br><br> &nbsp&nbspIn libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the  &nbsp&nbsplibrary or the users it has been issued to etc.
<br><br> &nbsp&nbspIn both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.

<br> &nbsp&nbspAssume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array  &nbsp&nbsplike a data structure where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index to store values. However, in cases where the keys are large and cannot  &nbsp&nbspbe used directly as an index, you should use hashing.

<br> &nbsp&nbspIn hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The  &nbsp&nbspidea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key  &nbsp&nbspyou can access the element in O(1) time.<br> &nbsp&nbsp Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.

<br> &nbsp&nbspHashing is implemented in two steps:

<br><br> &nbsp&nbsp1.An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls  &nbsp&nbspinto the hash table.<br>
<br> &nbsp&nbsp2.The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

<br> &nbsp&nbsphash = hashfunc(key)
<br> &nbsp&nbspindex = hash % array_size
<br>
<br> &nbsp&nbspIn this method, the hash is independent of the array size and it is then reduced to an index (a number between 0 and array_size − 1) by using the  &nbsp&nbspmodulo operator (%).
<br>
<br> &nbsp&nbsp<b>Hash function</b>
<br> &nbsp&nbspA hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table.  &nbsp&nbspThe values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is  &nbsp&nbspimportant to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp1.<b>Easy to compute</b>: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
<br> 
&nbsp&nbsp2.<b>Uniform distribution</b>: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.
<br> 
&nbsp&nbsp3.<b>Less collisions</b>: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp<b>Note</b>: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is &nbsp&nbspimportant to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.
