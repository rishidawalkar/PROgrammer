    <center><h3><b>Exception handling.</b></h3></center>
<br>
    <h5>&nbsp&nbspThe <b>Exception Handling</b> in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be &nbsp&nbspmaintained.
        <br>&nbsp&nbspIt is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the &nbsp&nbspapplication that is why we use exception handling.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Types of Exceptions</b>
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspThere are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is considered as the unchecked exception. <br>&nbsp&nbspAccording to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions:

<br>&nbsp&nbsp1.Checked Exception
<br>&nbsp&nbsp2.Unchecked Exception
<br>&nbsp&nbsp3.Error
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.Checked Exception</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, &nbsp&nbspSQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>2.Unchecked Exception</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, &nbsp&nbspArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>3.Error</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspError is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspException Keywords
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.try</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place exception code. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally. It &nbsp&nbspmeans, we can't use try block alone.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>2.catch</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block &nbsp&nbsplater.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>3.finally</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>4.throw</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>5.throws</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThe "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It doesn't throw an exception. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It is always used &nbsp&nbspwith method signature.
