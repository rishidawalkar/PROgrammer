<center><h3>Data types, Variables and Arrays.</h3></center>
<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp<h3><b>&nbsp&nbspData type</b></h3><h5>&nbsp&nbspIt specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier. The Java language is rich in its data types.<br>&nbsp Different data types allow you to select the type appropriate to the needs of the application.
   <br> &nbsp Data types in java are classified into 2 types:
      <br>&nbsp  1.Primitive
        2.Non-primitive.</h5>
    <h5>
    &nbsp 1. Primitive data types:<br>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspa. <b>Integer</b>: Integer data types can hold whole numbers such as 123 and −96. The size of the values that can be stored depends on the integer type &nbsp&nbspthat we choose.
        <br><br> &nbsp&nbspb. <b>floating point: </b>Floating point data types are used to represent numbers with a fractional part. <br>&nbsp&nbspSingle precision floating point numbers occupy 4 bytes and Double precision floating point numbers occupy 8 bytes.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspc. <b>character:</b> It stores character constants in the memory. It assumes a size of 2 bytes, but basically it can hold only a single character because char &nbsp&nbspstores unicode character sets.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspd. <b>Boolean:</b> Boolean data types are used to store values with two states: true or false.
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp2. Non-premitive data types:  It includes classes, Interfaces and arrays.

        <br><br><h3><b>&nbsp&nbspVariables</b> </h3><h5>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThere are different types of variables in Java. They are as follows:
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspa. <b>Instance variables:</b>  Objects store their individual states in “non-static fields”, that is, fields declared without the 'static' keyword.

Non-static fields &nbsp&nbspare also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class. <br>&nbsp&nbspFor example, the currentSpeed of one bicycle is independent from the currentSpeed of another.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspb. <b>class variables:</b> A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable &nbsp&nbspin existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated.
        <br>&nbsp&nbspA field defining the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked as static since, conceptually, the same number of gears will &nbsp&nbspapply to all instances. The code static int numGears = 6; would create such a static field.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspc.<b> local variables:</b> A method stores its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for &nbsp&nbspexample, int count = 0;). There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the location in which &nbsp&nbspthe variable is declared—between the opening and closing braces of a method. <br>&nbsp&nbspAs such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspd. <b>parameters:</b> They are the variables that are passed to the methods of a class.

        <br><br><h3>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Arrays</b></h3><h5>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspAn array is a group of variables that share the same data type, and are referred to by a common name. Arrays of any type can be created and may &nbsp&nbsp one or more dimensions.<br>&nbsp&nbspA specific element in an array is accessed by its index. The array index ranges from 0 to n−1; therefore, in an array of size 10, the first element is &nbsp&nbspstored at index 0 and the last or the 10th element at index 9.
