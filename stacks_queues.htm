<center><h3>Stacks and Queues.</h3></center>
<br>
<h5> &nbsp&nbspA <b>stack</b> is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. <br>&nbsp&nbspIn the pushdown stacks only two &nbsp&nbspoperations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited &nbsp&nbspaccess data structure - elements can be &nbsp&nbspadded and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop &nbsp&nbspremoves the item from the top. <br>&nbsp&nbspA helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.<br>
&nbsp&nbspA stack is a recursive data structure. <br>&nbsp&nbspHere is a structural definition of a Stack:

a stack is either empty or
it consistes of a top and the rest which is a stack.</h5><br>

<h5>&nbsp&nbspA <b>queue</b> is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.<br> &nbsp&nbspAn excellent example of a queue is a line of students in the food court of the UC. New additions to a line made to the back of the queue, while &nbsp&nbspremoval (or serving) happens in the front. In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue. <br>&nbsp&nbspEnqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item. The picture demonstrates the FIFO access.
&nbsp&nbspThe difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item &nbsp&nbspthe least recently added.</h5>
