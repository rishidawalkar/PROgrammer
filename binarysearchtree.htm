<center><h3>Binary search tree.</h3></center>
<br>
<h5>
  &nbsp&nbspFor a binary tree to be a binary search tree, the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be less than the data of the root. &nbsp&nbspThe data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be greater than the data of the root.
</h5>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/fe0eac0.png" width="400" height="300"><br>
<br>
<h5>
 &nbsp&nbsp By referring the figure,we can see that 10 is a root node of the tree.
 <br>&nbsp&nbsp The data of the nodes at the left side of the root node are [5,1,6] which are less than the data of the root node.
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp The data of the nodes at that right side of the root node are [19,17] which are greater than the data of the root node.
 <br>&nbsp&nbsp Similar scenario is in case of the left side of the root node.
  <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp As for the left side of 10, 5 is the root node. 
 <br>&nbsp&nbsp Here, data of the left node is less than that of the root node i.e; 1 is less than 5.
  whereas, data of the right node is greater than that of the root &nbsp&nbspnode i.e; 6 is greater than 5.
<br>
  &nbsp&nbspAs for the right side of the 10, 19 is the root.
   Here, data of the left node is less than that of the root node i.e; 17 is less than 19.
