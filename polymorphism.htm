<center><h3>Polymorphism.</h3></center>
<br>
    <h5><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Polymorphism</b> is the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
<br>&nbsp&nbspReal life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an &nbsp&nbspemployee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>Types of polymorphism</b>
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.Dynamic polymorphism</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspThis form of polymorphism doesn’t allow the compiler to determine the executed method. The JVM needs to do that at runtime.
        <br>&nbsp&nbspWithin an inheritance hierarchy, a subclass can override a method of its superclass
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp<b>1.Static polymorphism</b>
        <br>&nbsp&nbspJava, like many other object-oriented programming languages, allows you to implement multiple methods within the same class that use the same &nbsp&nbspname but a different set of parameters. That is called method overloading and represents a static form of polymorphism.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbspDue to the different sets of parameters, each method has a different signature. That allows the compiler to identify which method has to be called &nbsp&nbspand to bind it to the method call. This approach is called static binding or static polymorphism.
