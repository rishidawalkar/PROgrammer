<center><h3>Graphs.</h3></center>
<br>
<h5>&nbsp&nbspA <b>graph</b> is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them.<br>
&nbsp&nbspGraphs are used to solve real-life problems that involve representation of the problem space as a network. Examples of networks include telephone &nbsp&nbspnetworks, circuit networks, social networks (like LinkedIn, Facebook etc.).
<br>
&nbsp&nbspFor example, a single user in Facebook can be represented as a node (vertex) while their connection with others can be represented as an edge &nbsp&nbspbetween nodes.

Each node can be a structure that contains information like user’s id, name, gender, etc.
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspTypes of graphs:<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp<b>Undirected Graph</b>:
In an undirected graph, nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional. For example if an edge connects node 1 and 2, &nbsp&nbspwe can traverse from node 1 to node 2, and from node 2 to 1.
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp<b>Directed Graph:</b>
In a directed graph, nodes are connected by directed edges – they only go in one direction. For example, if an edge connects node &nbsp&nbsp1 and 2, but the arrow head points towards 2, we can only traverse from node 1 to node 2 – not in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRQlJGjJXRUI_1zDNqrvJmdSsCiOGsvK1iEXp6zdpO6kYHT6PMs"><br><br>
 &nbsp&nbspTypes of Graph Representations:<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp<b>Adjacency List</b>:
To create an Adjacency list, an array of lists is used. The size of the array is equal to the number of nodes.

A single index, array[i] &nbsp&nbsp(VertexID) represents the list of nodes adjacent to the ith node.
<br><br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://lagodiuk.github.io/images/adj_lists/img_2.png"><br><br>
 <b>&nbsp&nbspAdjacency Matrix</b>:
An Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of nodes in a graph. A slot matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that &nbsp&nbspthere is an edge from node i to node j.
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GahiR.jpg" width="250" height="350"><br>
