<h5>
  &nbsp&nbspA <b>sorting</b> algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and &nbsp&nbsplexicographical order.<br> &nbsp&nbspEfficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be &nbsp&nbspin sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.
<br>
  <br>&nbsp&nbspBasically,there are various types of sorting:<br>
 <br> &nbsp&nbsp1.Bubble sort:<br><br>&nbsp&nbspBubble sort is an algorithm that compares the adjacent elements and swaps their positions if they are not in the intended order. The order can be &nbsp&nbspascending or descending.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspWorking of Bubble sort:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/303/1*NVr-P4YwNUFeB200MyCWFQ.jpeg" width="250" height="350"><br><br>&nbsp&nbspFor more details of bubble sort:

  <br>&nbsp&nbsp2.Insertion sort:<br><br>&nbsp&nbspInsertion sort works in the similar way as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.

<br>&nbsp&nbspWe assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on &nbsp&nbspthe right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put at their right place.

A similar approach is used by insertion &nbsp&nbspsort.

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspWorking of Insertion sort:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://www.codenuclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insertion_sort.jpg" width="250" height="350"><br>
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp3.Selection sort:<br><br>&nbsp&nbspSelection sort is an algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of &nbsp&nbspthe unsorted list.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspWorking of selection sort:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8sAXY99UinQ/V_57iEbGdwI/AAAAAAAAEyg/bDz3EaFy9t0-ell_kuwuprPCovN-mCBIgCLcB/s640/SelectionSort.png" width="250" height="350"><br><br>
  <br>&nbsp&nbsp4.Merge sort:<br><br>&nbsp&nbspMerge Sort is a kind of Divide and Conquer algorithm in computer programrming. It is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and a great way &nbsp&nbspto develop confidence in building recursive algorithms.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspWorking of Merge sort:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/merge-sort-example_0.jpg" width="450" height="350">

  <br>&nbsp&nbsp5.Quick sort:<br><br>&nbsp&nbspQuicksort is an algorithm based on divide and conquer approach in which the array is split into subarrays and these sub-arrays are recursively &nbsp&nbspcalled to sort the elements.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspWorking of Quick sort:<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://cdn.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/06/illustration-of-the-quicksort-algorithm.png" width="450" height="350">
